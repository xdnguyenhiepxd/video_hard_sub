00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I found a love for me

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Oh, darling, just dive right in and follow my lead

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Oh, I never knew you were the someone waiting for me

5
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love

6
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Not knowing what it was

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I will not give you up this time

8
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
But darling, just kiss me slow

9
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Your heart is all I own

10
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:02,000
And in your eyes, you're holding mine

11
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms

12
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favourite song

13
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:28,000
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath

14
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:41,000
But you heard it, darling, you look perfect tonight

15
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Well, I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know

16
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:56,000
She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home

17
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I found a love, to carry more than just my secrets

18
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:10,000
To carry love, to carry children of our own

19
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
We are still kids, but we're so in love

20
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Fighting against all odds

21
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I know we'll be alright this time

22
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Darling, just hold my hand

23
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Be my girl, I'll be your man

24
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I see my future in your eyes

25
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms

26
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favorite song

27
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:05,000
When I saw you in that dress, looking so beautiful

28
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I don't deserve this, darling, you look perfect tonight

29
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms

30
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favorite song

31
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I have faith in what I see

32
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Now I know I have met an angel in person

33
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
And she looks perfect

34
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I don't deserve this, you look perfect tonight
